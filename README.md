# ppa-script

A simple script that creates a PPA for packages downloaded from various sources

## Why?

Downloading and installing DEBs by hand got annoying. So I created a script!

## Examples

Take a look at the [example config](/config.example.sh) or at the [config deployed at deb.mkg20001.io](https://deb.mkg20001.io/config/config.sh)

## Docs

The examples and comments are the only docs.
